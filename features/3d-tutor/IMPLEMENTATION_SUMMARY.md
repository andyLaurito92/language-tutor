### üìä **MODERATE COMPLEXITY**
- **Development Time**: 4-6 months with 2-3 developers
- **Technical Risk**: Medium (well-established technologies)
- **Integration Effort**: Significant but manageable

### üí∞ **STRONG ROI POTENTIAL**
- Expected 40-60% increase in user engagement
- 25-35% improvement in learning retention
- Premium pricing justification (2-3x current rates)
- Market differentiation for 2-3 years

## üèóÔ∏è Recommended Architecture

### **Technology Stack**
```javascript
Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Three.js/React Three Fiber
Backend:  FastAPI (enhanced) + Python (existing components)
3D:       WebGL + Three.js + Optimized GLTF models
Audio:    Web Audio API + Enhanced phoneme analysis
```

### **Integration Approach**
1. **Progressive Migration**: Replace Streamlit with modern web framework
2. **Modular Development**: Build 3D system alongside existing chat interface
3. **Fallback Support**: Maintain 2D chat option for compatibility
4. **API Bridge**: WebSocket connection between 3D frontend and Python backend
